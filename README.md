Introduction
============

[DMRITool](http://diffusionmritool.github.io/) is a **free** and **open source** toolbox for [diffusion MRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) data processing. 
It is written in C++ with matlab interface. 

With DMRITool, you can:

* perform reconstruction/estimation of diffusion data, including diffusion weighted signal, ensemble average propagator (EAP), diffusion orientation distribution function (dODF), and some meaningful scalar maps, etc.
* generate spherically uniform sampling schemes for single or multiple shells.
* perform diffusion MRI data simulation.
* visualize spherical function field (e.g. dODF field, EAP profile field)
